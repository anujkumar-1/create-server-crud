# Simple Node.js HTTP Server with File System Interaction

This is a basic Node.js HTTP server script that demonstrates handling HTTP requests, serving HTML content, and interacting with the file system.

## Getting Started

To run this Node.js server script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone this repository or download the `server.js` file to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the `server.js` file is located.
4. Run the command `node server.js` to start the server.

Once the server is running, you can access it by navigating to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Functionality

### Homepage (`/`)

- When you visit the homepage (`/`), the server reads the content of a file named `message.txt` and displays it in an HTML form.
- Below the form, there is a text input field and a submit button. You can enter a message in the input field and click the submit button to send the message to the server.

### Message Submission (`/message`)

- When you submit a message via the form on the homepage, the message is sent to the server using a POST request to the `/message` endpoint.
- The server reads the message from the request body, extracts it, and writes it to the `message.txt` file.
- After writing the message to the file, the server responds with a 302 status code and redirects the client back to the homepage (`/`).

### Other Routes

- If you visit any other route besides `/` or `/message`, the server responds with a simple HTML page displaying the message "Hello from my Node.js Server!"

## Dependencies

This script uses two core Node.js modules:

- `http`: To create an HTTP server and handle HTTP requests.
- `fs` (File System): To read from and write to files on the server's file system.
